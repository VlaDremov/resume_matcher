Job Description

As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer, you’ll focus on designing and implementing reusable ML templates, deployment patterns, and MLOps tooling that support scalable, reliable, and secure ML solutions across the organisation.


You’ll collaborate closely with ML Engineers and Scientists embedded in product teams such as Forecasting, Recommendations, Marketing, Customer, and Pricing helping them accelerate delivery and improve the quality of ML systems by providing a robust and standardised ML development experience.


What you’ll be doing:


Designing and developing shared ML engineering templates, tooling, and infrastructure to support ML teams across ASOS.
Driving standardisation and reusability of ML workflows, enabling consistency across diverse product domains.
Enabling teams to productionise ML models efficiently by providing best practices, templates, and technical support.
Implementing and promoting ML Ops principles — including CI/CD for ML, model registries, monitoring, testing, and feature management.
Collaborating with ML teams to understand pain points and evolve the platform accordingly.
Partnering with Data Engineering, Platform Engineering, and Security teams to ensure scalable and cost-efficient ML infrastructure.
We believe being together in person helps us move faster, connect more deeply, and achieve more as a team. That’s why our approach to working together includes spending at least 2 days a week in the office. It’s a rhythm that speeds up decision-making, helps ASOSers learn from each other more quickly, and builds the kind of culture where people can grow, create, and succeed.
